# Aspect-Category-Detection-Model

This is the software that accompanies the paper "Sentence Vector Representation Methods for Aspect Category Detection" by Noman Dilawar, Hammad Majeed. The paper describes our model for Aspect Category Detection in Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task of SemEval-2016. 

For Aspect Category Detection (Subtask1/Slot1), we used multiple methods to represent a sentence vector using algebraic combination of its word vectors. Feature vector is then directly used to train a multi-layer neural network for multi-label sentence classification algorithm. The proposed model is tested on a real world online challenge (SE-ABSA 2016). The experimental results of our approach has shown the highest F1 scores and outperforms the existing approaches.
